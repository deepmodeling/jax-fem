| [Poisson equation](poisson/example) | ${\color{green}Basics:}$  Poisson's equation in a unit square domain with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, as well as a source term. |
| [Linear elasticity](linear_elasticity/example) | ${\color{green}Basics:}$  Bending of a linear elastic beam due to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Second order tetrahedral element (TET10) is used. |
